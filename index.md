*My website is currently under construction.*

I am a final year PhD biomathematics student under the supervision of Dr Philipp Thomas and Dr Alexis R. Barr at Imperial College London. In my PhD, I use stochastic models in combination with live cell imaging data to decode interdivision time heterogeneity and reveal the factors that drive the cell cycle.

As I am approaching end of my PhD, I am starting to look for my next position, and I am open to both Postdocs and careers outside academic. If you have any opportunities in mind, please get in touch!
