#### Final year PhD student in biomathematics

###### Imperial College London & MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences

I am a final year PhD student in the department of mathematics under the supervision of Dr Philipp Thomas and Dr Alexis R. Barr. My research focus is on mathematical biology. In my PhD, I use stochastic models in combination with live cell imaging data to decode interdivision time heterogeneity and reveal the factors that drive the cell cycle.
